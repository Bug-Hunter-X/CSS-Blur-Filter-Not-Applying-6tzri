# CSS Blur Filter Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where the CSS `filter: blur()` property is not applying a blur effect to an element as expected.  The element itself is visible and styled correctly, but the blur is absent.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential solution.

**To reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (which you'll need to create, linking to the CSS files) in a web browser.
3. Observe that the expected blur effect is missing. 

**Possible causes:**
* **Z-index issues:** An element with a higher z-index may be overlapping and obscuring the blurred element.
* **Incompatible browser:** Some older or less common browsers might have issues with CSS filters.
* **Conflicting CSS rules:** Other CSS rules might be overriding the filter property.
* **Incorrect filter value:** Check if the blur radius value is valid and correctly specified.
* **Parent element properties:** Properties on parent elements might be interfering.

**Debugging steps:**
1. Inspect the element using browser developer tools.
2. Check for conflicting styles or CSS specificity issues.
3. Verify the browser's CSS filter support.
4. Test with different browser versions.
5. Simplify the CSS to isolate the problem.
